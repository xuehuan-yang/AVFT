### Autonomous Vehicle Fidelity Testing

```bash
Research shows that the autonomous vehicles have to driven billions of miles to demonstrate their liabilty. 

Testing autonomous driving algorithms on real vehicles is extremely costly.

Many researches and developers perform fidelity testing with correspoinding sensors and maps.
